# odin-recipes
Currently, I am a relatively green website developer.
I am making a project for a website that displays recipes.
I will come back to you with more details once I know what's going on. @ 8/22/22

I am now back after getting a new house and job (not in tech yet)
Finally, after a millenia I am a senior at university so I can land a tech job(eventually) @ 4/28/2023
